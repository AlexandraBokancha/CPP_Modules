**This module is designed to help you understand templated containers, iterators and algorithms in CPP.**

The Standart Template Library

Most of the templates in the STL can be grouped into the following categories:

	• Containers: Class templates for objects that store and organize data
	• Iterators: Class templates for objects that behave like pointers, and are used to access
	the individual data elements in a container
	• Algorithms: Function templates that perform various operations on elements of
	containers
