**Containers**

A **container** is an object that holds a collection of values or other objects.
An **iterator** is an object that is used to iterate over the items in a collection, providing access to them.

1. **sequence** container stores its data sequentially in memory, 
in a fashion similiar to an array;

2. **associative** container stores its data in a nonsequential
way that makes it faster to locate elements;

**vector class**

A vector is a sequence container that works like an array,
but is dynamic in size;

Advantages of a vector over an array:
- You do not have to declare the size of a vector when you define it;
- A vector is dynamic in size. You can add elements to it, or delete
elements from it at runtime. The vector automatically adjusts its size
according to the number of elements it contains;
- A vector can report the number of elements it contains;
